# Cact.us

#### Cact.us is a hackathon management platform for organizer teams to handle registrations, emailing and project submissions 

###### Hackathons Present Organizational Challenges

*	Capturing and accessing registration information is tedious and difficult using excel or other form 
	handler methods.

*	Allowing registrants to update registration and see the status of their application is technically 	    not possible for a number of registration platforms.

*	Making decisions on applications and consequently sending the results to registrants involves clunky 	 email chains and slow response times

*	Handling travel reimbursement is a logistical challenge where registrants are reliant on the 			approval process in order to attend the event as well as face inefficient methods of sending the 		required reimbursement forms.

*	Finding a suitable project submission platform and cross-referencing registrant information with 		project submissions data is tedious.
